            <h2> Philip J. Fry</h2>

                <li>Species: Human</li><br>
                <li>Age: 25-44 </li><br>
                Philip I is generally very lazy at work, spending most of his time in the office sitting on the couch:
                watching TV and drinking Slurm. This laziness has caused him to miss at least one delivery mission. He
                is often immature, which causes him to get into tight spots, usually forcing Turanga Leela to rescue
                him. Despite this, he is a good, sensitive and sentimental man who loves his friends and will usually
                go to any lengths to save them.

                <li>Age: 25-31 </li><br><br>
                With a "no rain or sleet" attitude and a "kick-your-ass" grace, this delivery captain is a refreshing
                source of professionalism to counterpoint the rest of the crew. For better or worse, the ship runs on
                her high octane passions, be it because of her longing for family, her love of violence, her commitment
                to a job well done, or her affection for animals. She has been known to scrap the missions on a whim on
                the promise of learning more of her past, jeopardize the crew's lives to spite Zapp Brannigan and save
                Nibbler. Leela was the first female Blernsball player and the worst player ever because of her poor
                depth perception (this is due to the fact that she has one eye). However, in space, depth perception is
                less useful because things are further away and so Leela is captain of the Planet Express ship.

                Bender drinks copious amounts of alcohol to recharge his fuel cells, while displaying symptoms similar
                to intoxication when he stops. When he burps, fire comes out of his mouth. He gambles, smokes cigars,
                consorts with hookerbots, and is constantly trying to gain attention to boost his already over-inflated
                ego. He is equipped with a Gaydar, though it ultimately claims everyone is gay. He currently lives with Fry in his closet-sized Apartment, fully
                equipped with an apartment-sized closet. He hates his self-destruct sequence.He has an affinity for
                turtles (as they both can't get off their back), penguins, and Napoleon Bonaparte. Bender was made
                Pharaoh on the planet O'Cyris IV, but his servants, fed up with inhumane treatment, sent him to his
                grave (before he actually died). His mugshot id number is 01473.

                <li>Age: 159 - 165</li><br><br>
                Professor Farnsworth is a senile, deranged, as well as unpredictable old man who is both a maniac and a
                genius who was born in prison as mentioned in "Overclockwise". He has a gift and passion for the
                creation of Doomsday Devices and Atomic Supermen and is a danger to himself, his employees, as well as
                the Universe in general. He has put at least one parallel universe in peril with his inventions.
                When he was a teenager he was put in a mental institute but got out 25 years later. Professor
                Farnsworth formerly worked for Mom's Friendly Robot Company and taught at Mars University. He currently
                spends the majority of his time inventing ridiculous devices and coming up with equally ridiculous and
                suicidal missions for his crew members.

                <li>Species: Human </li><br>
                <li>Age: 22-28</li><br><br>
                Amy is a klutzy, girly-girl who likes to party a lot. She is kind of spoiled due to her parents being
                rich and she once had a time where she used to look down on the poor. She has a sense of justice and
                patriotism, but gets frustrated when in desperate and hard situations. She constantly gets guilt-ridden
                and is always naive, falling for many things, including when she thought that Fry was actually
                interested in her, which he never was. Amy is also bad at placing and losing things such as failing to
                hide her wallet in her pocket fully only to have it stolen by people like Bender. She is rebellious
                against her parents in their many immoral schemes, once even to destroy twelve percent of the Milky Way
                to build a giant "mini golf course".

                <li>Species: Human</li><br>
                <li>Age: 41-47</li><br><br>
                Hermes is a hardworking man who deeply cares about his job at Planet Express. He's friendly to most
                characters, but consistently picks on Doctor Zoidberg (cutting paychecks, attempting to fire him, etc).
                He can occasionally be sensitive however, such as when he saved a young Bender. Hermes has a dream of
                winning the Olympic Gold medal for limbo and his archrival is Barbados Slim. He also seems to dislike
                all his coworkers, with the possible exception of Fry and Leela.

                <li>Species: Decapodian</li><br>
                <li>Age: 92</li><br><br>
                He is portrayed as a dumb, incompetent doctor due to his frequent surgical mishaps and misdiagnoses but
                he shows he is far from stupid as he shows he has knowledge in alien anatomy (not human, though he is a
                self-proclaimed "human expert") and has a Ph.D. in Art History. It was even questioned as to why the
                Professor does not fire him until it is revealed that he is a long time friend and crew member of
                Hubert's. Thus, the Professor won't fire him even though he has shown to be vastly incompetent at his
                job and is hated by most of his co-workers.
                Out of all the Planet express crew members, Zoidberg is considered to be the most caring and innocent
                member of the crew. He is a sweet and lovable guy who just wants a friend to hang out with but for some
                reason, most people dislike him, especially Hermes. Despite this, Zoidberg considers everyone to be his
                friend. However, out of all his co-workers (besides the Professor), Fry is the only one that treats
                John decently and refers to Zoidberg as a friend. At Fry's memorial in "Bender's Big Score", when Leela
                stated they would all miss Fry, John reveals that "He was the only one of you who never struck me!"
